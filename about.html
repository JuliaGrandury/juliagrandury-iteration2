            <p> As a child, I was known to never sit still. I always had to explore what was
            behind a door, test the strength of a barrier,
            or climb to the top of a tree to see past what everybody else saw.
            I never accepted things to be one dimensioned and felt the need to explore every
            aspect of them. This curiosity and desire to understand have remained fundamental
            to the person I continue to grow into and create.</p>

                    I volunteered as Stage Crew for the South by Southwest concerts between 03/14/22 and 03/20/22.
                    I facilitated the stage setup and production while also accomodating for the needs of artists.
                    This enabled me to attend events during the rest of the week such as SXSW talks and panels.

                    typically been over the age of 60. As they were more vulnerable to COVID-19, few were comfortable
                    with working the polls during the pandemic. Thus, in November of 2020, the nation faced a shortage
                    of poll workers leaving some polling locations at risk of being understaffed or unable to open. This 
                    motivated me to volunteer as a poll worker for the presidential elections.
