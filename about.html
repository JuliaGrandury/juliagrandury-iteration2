            <p> As a child, I was known to never sit still. I always had to explore what was 
                behind a door, test the strength of a barrier, 
                or climb to the top of a tree to see past what everybody else saw.
                I never accepted things to be one dimensioned and felt the need to explore every 
                aspect of them. This curiosity and desire to understand have remained fundamental
                to the person I continue to grow into and create.

                <!-- Originally from France and Spain, but having grown up mostly in New York, I am the
                product of a complex and nuanced set of experiences. 
                Growing up, I lived in two different worlds. In one of these I was brought up in the French and 
                Spanish customs, surrounded by my family. But, in the other, I was alone, 
                discovering uncharted territories. I had entered a world my family had little knowledge 
                of or control over. I was raised by my choice of music, books and movies 
                that they have never known, but that were my stepping stones into the American culture.
                Through these experiences I learned independence

                    I volunteered as Stage Crew for the South by Southwest concerts between 03/14/22 and 03/20/22.
                    I facilitated the stage setup and production while also accomodating for the needs of artists. 
                    This enabled me to attend events during the rest of the week such as SXSW talks and panels.

                    typically been over the age of 60. As they were more vulnerable to COVID-19, few were comfortable 
                    with working the polls during the pandemic. Thus, in November of 2020, the nation faced a shortage of 
                    poll workers leaving some polling locations at risk of being understaffed or unable to open. This is
                    what motivated me to volunteer as a poll worker for the presidential elections.
