            <p>FIX THIS PART HERE!
                As a child, I was known to never sit still. I always had to explore what was 
                behind a door, test the strength of a barrier, 
                or climb to the top of a tree to see past what everybody else saw.
                I never accepted things to be one dimensioned and felt the need to explore every 
                aspect of them. This curiosity and desire to understand have remained fundamental
                to the person I continue to grow into and create.

                <!-- Originally from France and Spain, but having grown up mostly in New York, I am the
                product of a complex and nuanced set of experiences. I grew up in a culture that 
                my parents could not guide me through

                Show: trusthworthiness, dependability, resilience, and independence/initiative 
                (want someone willing to figure shit out on their own; someone who will try to 
                figure things out and then if they can't or if it's for something they really
                can't lose time on, they'll come to you)

                Originally from France and Spain, but having grown up mostly in New York, I am the
                product of a complex and nuanced set of experiences. Music and dance have guided me through 
                many of these. They are the foundation of my connection to each of my cultures.
                I don't walk from point A to point B, I dance from point A to point B with music
                setting the rhythm to my day. -->
